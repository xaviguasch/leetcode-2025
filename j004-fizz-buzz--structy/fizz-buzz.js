// fizz buzz
// Write a function, fizzBuzz, that takes in a number n as an argument. The function should return an array containing numbers from 1 to n, replacing certain numbers according to the following rules:

// if the number is divisible by 3, make the element "fizz"
// if the number is divisible by 5, make the element "buzz"
// if the number is divisible by 3 and 5, make the element "fizzbuzz"

const fizzBuzz = (n) => {
  // todo
};

console.log(fizzBuzz(11)); // -> [1,2,"fizz",4,"buzz","fizz",7,8,"fizz","buzz",11]
