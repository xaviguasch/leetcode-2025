// intersection
// Write a function, intersection, that takes in two arrays, a,b, as arguments. The function should return a new array containing elements that are in both of the two arrays.

// You may assume that each input array does not contain duplicate elements.

const intersection = (a, b) => {
  // todo
};

console.log(intersection([4, 2, 1, 6], [3, 6, 9, 2, 10])); // -> [2,6]
