// intersection with dupes
// Write a function, intersectionWithDupes, that takes in two arrays, a,b, as arguments. The function should return a new array containing elements that are common to both input arrays. The elements in the result should appear as many times as they occur in both input arrays.

// You can return the result in any order.

const intersectionWithDupes = (a, b) => {};

console.log(intersectionWithDupes(["a", "b", "c", "b"], ["x", "y", "b", "b"]));
// -> ["b", "b"]
