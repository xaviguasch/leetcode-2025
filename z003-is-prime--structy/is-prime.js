// is prime
// Write a function, isPrime, that takes in a number as an argument. The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not the given number is prime.

// A prime number is a number that is only divisible by two distinct numbers: 1 and itself.

// For example, 7 is a prime because it is only divisible by 1 and 7. For example, 6 is not a prime because it is divisible by 1, 2, 3, and 6.

// You can assume that the input number is a positive integer.

const isPrime = (n) => {
  // todo
  if (n < 2) return false;

  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
    if (n % i === 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
};

// n = length of array
// Time: O(n)
// Space: O(1)

console.log(isPrime(7));
