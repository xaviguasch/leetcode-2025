// factorial
// Write a function, factorial, that takes in a number n and returns the factorial of that number. The factorial of n is the product of all the positive numbers less than or equal to n. You must solve this recursively.

// For example, the factorial of 6 is:

// 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720
// You can assume that n is a non-negative integer. Note that the factorial of 0 is defined to be 1 (wiki).

const factorial = (n) => {
  // todo
};

console.log(factorial(3));
